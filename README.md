# Pied Piper Memory Game

## Overview

* Pied Piper Memory Game is a web-game application to test your memory using characters from HBO's show about the tech industry, Silicon Valley. Users must try not to click the same image twice in the same round. Through the game a score is kept for the userâ€™s streak, as well as a message to whether they win or lose at the game. This game was built entirely with React.

## How to Play

* Points are earned by clicking an image of a contestant that hasn't already been clicked.

* After every click, the images of the characters will shuffle, so you can't rely on their initial positioning on the page.

* You win if you reach 12 points, you lose if you click incorrectly.

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* Bootstrap
